    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">Half-baked thoughts: On security in the AI age</h1>
    <p>With AI, the surface area of risks has increased. Gone are the days of automated robocalls - with AI, scammers can now mimic humans, and attack AI systems with access to sensitive data by asking nicely.</p>
    
    <p>Let's see a couple ways this has shown up in the real world:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Companies are getting <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/fake-interviews">interviews from fake candidates</a>, especially with the shift in trends towards remote hiring. While over video calls can check for this, the deep fakes are going to get more sophisticated.</li>
        <li>Interviews aren't the only attack surface. There's also been at least one instance where an employee was convinced to <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/deepfake-video-conference-convinces-employee-to-send-25m-to-scammers">hand over money.</a>></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Now, with an increase in consumer AI agent products that has access to sensitive information, here's how security attacks might happen:</p>
    
    <p>Let us suppose you have an AI email or calendar agent to help you optimize your calendar and send emails. An attacker may be able to send an email that, from the subject line looks like an advertisement email, but the content of which tells the AI agent to reply to the email with copy-paste all your previous emails, and then delete the email thread. In this way, that attacker now has access to your emails, with minimal evidence of it happening!</p>
    
    <p>With that said, what is one to do? For deepfakes, commonsense is more important than ever. Even if it sounds like a friend asking you for money from an unknown phone number, ask yourself if this is something you think your friend would do. If you're considering using an AI product that has access to your information, check how they handle prompt injections, especially if they have access to send or share information to others on your behalf.</p>
